	<h1>How does writing CSS differ from writing HTML?</h1>
	<p>As we write CSS these are the type of questions we might ask ourselves:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Should we layout the text in a single or double column?</li>
		<li>Should we use a different font color for the header?</li>
		<li>How should the very same content appear differently on a desktop vs. a mobile device?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>All of the questions above deal with esthetic and function considerations. These are the perspectives of the presentational layer (CSS).</p>
	<p>Let's consider the type of questions we might ask ourselves as we write HTML:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Does the order of items within a list matter? Should it be a numbered list?</li>
		<li>Should we wrap a list of links inside a navigation tag?</li>
		<li>Is this the most important header in the whole HTML document?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The last few questions deal with structure, hierarchy, and meaning. These are the perspectives of the content layer (HTML).</p>
	<p>When we write CSS we focus on esthetic and function considerations. When we write HTML we focus on structure, hierarchy, and meaning.</p>
